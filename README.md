## Introduction
As a data scientist participating in the Swiggy Restaurant Data Analysis Hack-a-thon, you have a unique opportunity to explore and analyze real-life restaurant data from Swiggy. This dataset contains information about various restaurants listed on the Swiggy website, including details like cuisine, cost, ratings, and more. Your task is to leverage your data science skills to gain insights into the restaurant industry and present your findings in an interactive web application using Dash.

## Overview
In this project, we aim to perform a comprehensive data analysis of Swiggy restaurant data from all over India. By exploring the dataset, we will identify trends, popular cuisines, top-rated restaurants, and other valuable insights. We will also create an interactive web application using Dash to showcase our analysis, making it accessible and engaging for users.

## Dataset
**About Dataset**
The dataset contains 10 different features for each restaurant listed on the Swiggy website. These features include unique IDs, restaurant names, cities, ratings, the number of ratings, cost, cuisines served, license numbers, restaurant links, and full addresses.

**Context**
The dataset is a valuable resource for students to explore the field of data science using real-life data. Analyzing Swiggy's restaurant data will provide insights into the food delivery market and help understand the restaurant industry based on various factors like cuisine, cost, states, regions, reviews, ratings, etc.
