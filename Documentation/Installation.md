# Installation Guide for Data Analysis

## Introduction to Data Analysis
Data analysis is a crucial step in the data science workflow, where we extract meaningful insights from raw data. It involves various processes like data cleaning, visualization, and modeling. In this guide, we will walk you through the installation process for the required tools and libraries to perform data analysis effectively.

## Anaconda IDE
Anaconda is a popular open-source distribution of Python and R for data science and machine learning tasks. It comes with a wide range of pre-installed libraries and tools, making it the ideal choice for data analysis projects.

### Installing Anaconda on Windows 11
1. Visit the Anaconda website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Download the Anaconda installer for Windows.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Select "Add Anaconda to the system PATH environment variable" during installation for easy access to Anaconda from the command line.

## Python 3
Python is a powerful programming language widely used in data analysis and machine learning. Anaconda comes with Python pre-installed, but it's essential to ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Python Installation on Windows 11
1. Visit the Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the latest Python 3 installer for Windows.
3. Run the installer and select the option to add Python to the system PATH during installation.
4. Verify the installation by opening a command prompt and running the command `python --version`.

## Required Libraries
To perform data analysis, you'll need several essential Python libraries. Fortunately, Anaconda comes with many of them pre-installed. However, let's ensure we have the necessary ones for our analysis.

### Installing Libraries Using Anaconda
Open the Anaconda Navigator or Anaconda Prompt, and execute the following commands:

1. Numpy: `conda install numpy`
2. Pandas: `conda install pandas`
3. Modin: `conda install -c conda-forge modin`
4. Scikit-learn: `conda install scikit-learn`
5. Matplotlib: `conda install matplotlib`
6. Seaborn: `conda install seaborn`

## Testing Anaconda Installation
To verify that Anaconda is installed correctly and libraries are working, follow these steps:

1. Open Anaconda Navigator or Anaconda Prompt.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator or type `jupyter notebook` in the Anaconda Prompt.
3. Create a new Jupyter Notebook and import the installed libraries (e.g., `import numpy as np`, `import pandas as pd`, etc.).
4. Execute some basic code using the libraries to ensure they are functioning correctly.
